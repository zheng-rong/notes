Reinstall Unity in Ubuntu 14.04 to fix system freeze issue

Well, since you are stuck with a frozen system, use Ctrl+Alt+F2 key. This will take you to command line interface (instead of the default graphical user interface). You will be asked to enter your credentials. After you enter your username and password, use the following commands one by one to reinstall Unity desktop.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop
sudo apt-get install unity
sudo shutdown -r now

The last command will reboot your system. After the reboot, you should have Unity working as normal.
Fixing Unity freeze issue with Nvidia graphics:

I donâ€™t have experience with Nvidia graphics but I found some people mentioning additional steps for system with Nvidia graphics card. While the above trick worked for my system, I cannot verify the one below. People with Nvidia graphics, please confirm that the steps below work for your system:

Press Ctrl+Alt+F2 to use command line. And after entering username and password, use the following commands one by one:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop
sudo apt-get install unity
sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia*
sudo shutdown -r now

Once you have Unity back to normal at next reboot, just reinstall the Nvidia drivers (you had just removed them).

========================

1. Install different greeter

Occasionally, the default greeter (aka login screen ) won't work properly. I've encountered such issue with Fedora 20, where default gdm greeter would distort the login screen badly, and the persons on this post also said changing greeter (as suggested by myself) helped.

To change a greeter, access tty console (by pressing Ctrl+Alt +F*, where F* is any F1 - F6 key), login, and download a greeter that you would like to have. For instance,

sudo apt-get install lightdm-gtk-greeter

or sudo apt-get install lightdm-kde-greeter

Personally , I keep both of these on my machine.

Next, you need to tell lightdm desktop manager which greeter to choose on boot. To do that, type

sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf

Nano is a command-line text editor, IMHO simplest to use. Most likely, this config file will be blank, so you would need to add the following lines:

[SeatDefaults] greeter-session=lightdm-gtk-greeter

where lightdm-gtk-greeter , would be the name of the greeter you installed. Bellow is the screen shot of my lightdm.conf file.

enter image description here

For more information on lightdm display manager configurations, you can read the following sources, as well as man page for lightdm (man lightdm):

Arch Wiki Lightdm Ubuntu Help Lightdm

2. Reinstall Unity desktop or install different desktop

Among other problems, it could be your desktop environment.

To reinstall Ubuntu's default desktop, do the following in tty:

apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop
apt-get install unity

To install a different desktop environment, you can refer to this post

To select different default desktop environment you can edit /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-ubuntu.conf file. Again, you can do it using nano text editor.

sudo nano /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-ubuntu.conf

Bellow is screen shot of my file:

enter image description here

Again, the name after = sign should be the name of the desktop environment you've installed, and it should boot by default.

3. Possible graphics card driver issue.

This issue is somewhat beyond my level of knowledge right now, but I can point you to this post on Ubuntu Help page
